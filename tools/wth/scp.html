    <li>The Cyberbullying Research Center found over 34% of U.S. students faced cyberbullying. Many had emotional struggles because of this.</li>
    <li>Research found that students using the net more often during study sessions usually got lower grades compared to those who didn’t use it as much.</li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <li>In the 1960s! That’s when the idea for a global network started. The U.S. Department of Defense made ARPANET. This was a big step because it used packet switching to send data.</li>
    <li>Then came the 1970s and 1980s! The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) appeared. It helped different networks connect &amp; communicate better. This was key for growing the Internet.</li>
    <li>By the 1990s, everyday people could use it too! Commercial Internet Service Providers (ISPs) showed up. Plus, there was this cool thing called the Domain Name System (DNS). It made finding things online much easier!</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web while at CERN—how cool is that? He wanted to create a way to manage &amp; share info using hypertext.</li>
    <li>Fast forward to 1991! We saw the first website go live—woohoo! This was the start of something big.</li>
    <li>Then in 1993, along came Mosaic. This web browser made using the WWW super easy &amp; fun for everyone!</li>
    <li>From then till now—Wow! The WWW exploded in growth! It changed from plain pages to interactive ones that are rich with all sorts of media.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>TCP/IP is super important—it’s what lets data move through networks.</li>
    <li>Packet Switching breaks info into little packets so they can zoom independently across networks.</li>
    <li>DNS helps turn easy-to-read names into IP addresses that computers understand.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>There’s HTML! This is the standard language for building web pages &amp; applications.</li>
    <li>Also, HTTP/HTTPS are protocols for moving hypertext around on the Internet. HTTPS keeps things secure!</li>
    <li>You’ve got web browsers like Chrome, Firefox &amp; Safari. They help you find &amp; view all kinds of web stuff.</li>
    <li>URLs? They’re just fancy names for addresses we use to get to web resources.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>It connects tons of networks all over—think global connectivity!</li>
    <li>Email &amp; messaging services let us communicate anytime, whether it’s quick messages or emails.</li>
    <li>File sharing? Yup! Friends can send files back and forth easily with protocols like FTP.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Hypertext makes it super simple to jump from one document to another through links!</li>
    <li>Plus, there’s all this multimedia content—text, images, videos—you name it!</li>
    <li>Web applications like e-commerce sites and social media? They’re built using cool web technologies!</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Home Page:</strong> This is the main page. It shows an overview and links to other pages in the site.</li>
    <li><strong>Web Pages:</strong> These are individual pages written in HTML that you can visit through URLs.</li>
    <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> These are menus, links, and buttons that let users easily move around the website.</li>
    <li><strong>Multimedia Content:</strong> Think of text, images, videos, audio &amp; interactive stuff that keeps users interested.</li>
  </ol>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Crawling:</strong> Search engines send Tiny programs called crawlers or spiders to check out web pages all over the Internet. They gather data about what's on those pages.</li>
    <li><strong>Indexing:</strong> The data collected gets stored in a huge database called an index. This makes it quick for search engines to find relevant info when someone searches.</li>
    <li><strong>Ranking:</strong> When you type something in, the search engine looks at its index to figure out which results are the best fit. Things like keywords and page quality matter here!</li>
    <li><strong>Retrieval:</strong> Finally, the search engine gives you a list of sorted web pages with little previews of what each page is about.</li>
